# üè® Hotel Booking Demand & Cancellation Analysis

This project explores the key factors influencing hotel booking cancellations using in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques in Python. It reveals patterns across hotel types, customer behaviors, booking channels, and seasonality, helping stakeholders reduce cancellation rates and improve revenue forecasting.

## üìå Objective

To analyze hotel booking data and uncover actionable insights that can help reduce cancellations, improve pricing strategies, and increase customer satisfaction.

## üìä Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development and documentation
- **Tableau**: Summary dashboard for stakeholders
- **Excel**: Preliminary review of dataset and summary statistics

---

## üîç Key Insights & Findings

- **City Hotels have higher cancellation rates (41.7%)** compared to Resort Hotels (27.7%).
- **Longer lead times** are associated with higher cancellation probability.
- **Transient customers and group bookings** are the most likely to cancel.
- **No-deposit bookings** show the highest cancellation rates.
- **Guests with special requests are less likely to cancel**, indicating stronger intent to stay.
- **Most bookings are for 1‚Äì2 guests**, with seasonal peaks in July and August.

## üìà Visualizations

The project includes **20+ structured visualizations** under:

- **Univariate Analysis** ‚Äì Understand individual variable distributions  
- **Bivariate Analysis** ‚Äì Compare relationships between pairs (e.g., lead time vs. cancellations)  
- **Multivariate Analysis** ‚Äì Explore 3-variable relationships (e.g., ADR vs. Lead Time vs. Hotel Type)

Each visualization includes:
